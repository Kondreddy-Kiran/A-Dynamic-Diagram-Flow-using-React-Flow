Build a Dynamic Diagram Flow using React Flow
Objective: Create a dynamic diagram flow using React Flow that takes metadata as input
to render nodes and edges dynamically.
Task Details:
1. Project Overview:
Develop a React application that utilizes React Flow to create interactive diagram flows.
The diagram should be built based on dynamic metadata that defines nodes and their
relationships.
2. Requirements:
Use React Flow library for rendering the diagram.
Create a JSON schema to define the metadata structure that includes:
Nodes
Edges
Implement functionality to dynamically add, remove, and edit nodes and edges based on
user interactions.
Include a sidebar or modal for inputting metadata for nodes and edges.
Ensure the diagram is responsive and can handle various screen sizes.
Implement state management to handle the current diagram state (e.g., using React
Context or Redux).
3. Deliverables:
A fully functional React application with:
Dynamic rendering of the diagram based on the provided metadata.
UI components for adding, editing, and deleting nodes and edges.
Documentation detailing the architecture, setup, and usage of the application.
Sample metadata JSON file demonstrating how to structure nodes and edges.
